This repository holds the code for the Tyngsborough High School Robotics team's 2022 Botball game strategy.

## Viewing and using our code

The code in this repository contains _our team's code_ for _our strategy_ in the competition. While other teams may use it for guidance and inspiration, it would be cheating and against the spirit of the game to directly use our code for your team's robots. Therefore there are some conditions attached to the use of this repository, which you can read in the [license](LICENSE).

## Setup

Development requires a Wombat controller and a computer running macOS, Linux or WSL.

1. Clone the repository to your computer and open it in your favorite editor.
2. Make changes as needed.
3. Connect to your Wombat and use `run.sh demobot` or `run.sh create` to run the code. After running `run.sh`, you can also run the program from the program selector on the Wombat.
