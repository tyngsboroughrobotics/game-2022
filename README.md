This repository holds the code for the Tyngsborough High School Robotics team's 2021 Botball game strategy.

We developed and are using the [`botball`](https://github.com/tyngsboroughrobotics/botball) library for the [Wipple programming language](https://wipple.gramer.dev). The library is open source and we encourage other teams to use it and contribute!

## Viewing and using our code

The code in this repository contains _our team's code_ for _our strategy_ in the competition. While other teams may use it for guidance and inspiration, it would be cheating and against the spirit of the game to directly use our code for your team's robots. Therefore there are some conditions attached to the use of this repository, which you can read in the [license](LICENSE).

## Setup

Development requires a Wombat controller and a computer running macOS, Linux or WSL.

1. Install Wipple (https://wipple.gramer.dev).
2. Clone the repository to your computer and open it in your favorite editor.
3. Make changes as needed.
4. Connect to your Wombat and use `install.sh` to copy the code to the robot.
5. Run the code from the program selector, or use `run.sh` to run it remotely.
