The code in this repository contains our team's code for our strategy in the
Botball competition. While other teams may use it for guidance and inspiration,

   allowed for guidance and inspiration only, and not for use or incorporation
   into your robotics team's code.

2. After December 31, 2021, the contents of this repository as of December 31,
   2021 are available for everyone to view and use under the MIT License printed

   changes to this repository made after December 31, 2021 are subject to the
